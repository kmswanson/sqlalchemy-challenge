Module 10 Challenge - SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy was a really interesting tie in back into Jupyter as well as pandas and matplotlib. It was really nice to see things finally starting to come around full circle.
This module challenge had me use create_engine to connect Jupyter to the 'hawaii.splite' file, which allowed the data to be used inside of the Jupyter environment instead of PGAdmin4.
This was I think the most difficult part of this module challenge, to get everything working together.

The comeback to pandas and matplotlib was excellent, it really made all the things we have been learning come to life. 
It was also a good challenge to get the things to all work together to reach the proper results.
The bar graph was complicated, and while it looks different from the starter file, it shows the same data just in a less easy to read way.
The histogram was easier and displayed excellently for actual comprehension.

I referenced the lecture videos that are saved to Zoom as well as supplemental content provided to us by the instructor. 
Overall, this module was an excellent opportunity to bridge knowledge with hands-on practice.
